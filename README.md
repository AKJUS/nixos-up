# nixos-up

nixos-up is a dead-simple install wizard for NixOS. It's the fastest way to get from ISO to working installation.

From the NixOS installation USB/CD:

```
sudo nix-shell https://github.com/samuela/nixos-up/archive/main.tar.gz
```

You can check out a video demonstrating the process here: https://youtu.be/f7DzbiRD99Q.
