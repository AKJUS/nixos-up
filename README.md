# nixos-up

nixos-up is a dead-simple install wizard for NixOS. It's the fastest way to get from ISO to working installation.

From the NixOS installation USB/CD:

```
curl --fail --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samuela/nixos-up/main/nixos-up.ml > nixos-up.ml && chmod +x nixos-up.ml && sudo ./nixos-up.ml
```
